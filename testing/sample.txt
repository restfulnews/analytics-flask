CUSTOMER PROBLEM STATMENT
I am : A small buisnes owner who stock comes from overseas
I am trying to: To fill customer orders as quickly as possible
But: The latency between order and delivery is very long
Because: I need to order the inventory from overseas and I cant reliable forsee demand
Which makes me feel: Out of control as i can lose potential customers due to the latency or be overstocked

IDEAL STATE
In a perfect world: I know ahead of time what orders are going to come in and have the perfect amount of stock required
The biggest benefit to me is: I will never overstock or have to wait to fill orders
Which makes me feel: That I could capture all my buisness and develop my reputation

NEVER MISSES AN ORDER
